# Q&A from Student Zone Sessions
Hi everyone!

We're trying to pull out some popular questions from the Student Zone 
sessions to provide you with answers that live beyond the sessions!

### What is a Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador?
https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-us

### What advice do you have for an aspiring game dev with some programming experience?
First, I recommend you check out this session at Build [What CAN you do at Microsoft?](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/940692e9-f743-43d7-a431-5d4658014585?source=sessions).
Next, you should check out [Microsoft Game Stack](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/) and our [Azure Game Development Resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/gaming/). 
The biggest thing is to just try it out! I (@sguthals) started out by downloading [Unity](https://unity.com/) and folloing a simple tutorial :D 

### I always felt overwhelmed with trying to learn on my own. Would it be better to have an idea for a project and work towards completing it, or is it better to learn all the fundamental skills first? And where do you start with that?
YES! Having a project idea and then searching around for tutorials and resources to help you get through it is a GREAT idea! You can also check out 
[Microsoft Learn for Students](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/roles/student) where we have learning paths to help you get started!

### I am into software development. But I want to do something related to art or UI/UX. Is it possible to that wit microsoft?
100%! Again, I recommend you check out this session at Build [What CAN you do at Microsoft?](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/940692e9-f743-43d7-a431-5d4658014585?source=sessions).

### I want learn IOT, where or what do you recommend me to start? And any session(s) in this Build you recommend us to check out?
Yes! I recommend checking out one of the sessions with Scott Hanselman and Louanne Murphy:
