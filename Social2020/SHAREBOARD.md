# Tan Wei Liang Nathanael was at Microsoft Build 2020!

> Really enjoying the sessions a lot, with the humour, the light-hearted tone and the engaging speakers and moderators.

COVID-19 has brought us a lot of inconvenience but I tend to look on the brighter side of the picture, which is how Microsoft Build 2020 went digital and that means it's easily accessible for people anywhere and at anytime!

I wouldn't want to fly everywhere just to attend seminars when I can attend as much as I like from the comfort of my own home!

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/NatIsrael972

I am public transport oriented but have an adequate amount of IT background :)

```js
console.log( "Towards public transport excellence!" );

# Andrew Nakamura was at MS Build 2020

> Wow!! Thank you Microsoft and Build Conference 2020

There was so much to learn I couldn't catch it all.
My favorite non-tech session was  
Spotlight Series: Sketchnoting 101 CM308 BY [Nitya Narasimhan](https://twitter.com/nitya)
I'm going to push myself and do the challenge  

I also enjoyed the most of the student zone sessions like git and VSCode.  I knew a lot of it already but there were defintiely some good tricks I want to try out.

I also enjoyed Scott Hanselman and the way he did his presentation was really cool.

```js
console.log( "Bring on Azure!" );
```

It took me a day of sshing and accidentally cloning master and not my forked branch, but here I am!

**Terrible** *Wonderful* Things Build has Inspired:
* Set up ssh for the first time on Windows
* Set up a Ruby/Rails dev environment on Windows (with wsl)
* Rewrite my resume with LaTeX
* Figure out how to dev with Azure
* Begin Sketchnoting
* Learn Python and C++
* Begin my DevOps journey
* AI and Machine Learning!!

```ruby
def happy_message(your_name)
    puts "Stay inspired! You are awesome, #{your_name}! <3 Microsoft Build 2020!"\

# Jen Looper is loving MS Build 2020

> Hi everyone! I'll be doing a bunch of activities at MS Build 2020 but the one that students will love is a mindful programming activity: creating a terrarium with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no filler! Enjoy some hand-drawn succulents and craft a draggable interface where you can situate your plants in a terrarium created with just CSS. It's actually quite relaxing!

To view the final terrarium, clone or download [the repo](https://github.com/jlooper/my-terrarium) using the Master branch. To code along with me in the session, use the Student branch, which is incomplete. There are steps delineated where you need to complete the code - don't miss edits to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 

When you're done, view the terrarium locally by opening index.html in your browser, or commit your code to your GitHub account and use GitHub Pages to view it.

To do that, go to your GitHub repo where your terrarium lives and connect GitHub pages to the appropriate branch (probably your master branch) in Settings.

Enjoy your lovely terrarium! And tell me what you think of the experience (I'm on Twitter @jenlooper)!

## My version of FizzBuzz

Using [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar)

Midnight takes your heart and your soul
While your heart is as high as your soul
Put your heart without your soul into your heart

Give back your heart

Desire is a lovestruck ladykiller
My world is nothing 
Fire is ice
Hate is water
Until my world is Desire,
Build my world up
If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing and Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
Shout "FizzBuzz!"
Take it to the top

If Midnight taking my world, Fire is nothing
Shout "Fizz!"
Take it to the top

If Midnight taking my world, Hate is nothing
Say "Buzz!"
Take it to the top

Whisper my world

# Microsoft Build 2020 - *an experience*
> Learning coding concepts from experts and afficionados all for free!

Although I have coded before, the idea of attending a developer conference seemed scary to me. I thought the content would go right 
over my head, or that I would feel antagonized as woman in CS. I was pleased to find that this wasn't the case. Through 
interactive sessions that were tailored for students and which featured several female presenters, I got the satisfaction of 
`Build succesful` rather than the frustration of a `Runtime Error`. I have learned a lot in these past 8 hours, and I hope the next 
two days will be better and better!

/*Overview

Rust is used for almost anything and everything 

Used to write low level modules for Windows that were originally written in C/C++

Statically typed.

Cargo is the build system for Rust

Create a project for a guessing game by typing "cargo new new_guessing_game" in the terminal. A directory will be created called new_guessing_game.

A cargo.toml configuration file is created in that directory.

Install the random library by typing <code>rand = "0.7.3"<\code> underneath "[dependencies]" in cargo.toml (line 9).

For more information: https://www.rust-lang.org/

*/

use std::io;//import the standard i/o library
use rand::Rng;//random number library

No [fsharp](https://fsharp.org/) in MS Build :( . . .

```fsharp
let s = ":)"
printfn "Here we have a bit of fsharp! %s" s

It was an incredible experience to get to learn so much about Microsoft's cloud platform as well as all of the sessions that went into speaking about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm glad to have had the chance to be in attendance for my final year at university, before I can say 

```js
console.log("Hello world!");
```
